# **WicdPico: Wireless Instrumentation Control Platform**

## **Overview**

WicdPico (wireless instrumentation and control device - Pico) transforms your Raspberry Pi Pico W into a versatile wireless control platform that adapts to your instrumentation needs. Whether you need a standalone handheld instrument or a networked sensor node, wicdpico provides the modular foundation to build professional-grade control systems.

## **Dual Deployment Modes**

WicdPico operates in two distinct modes using the same hardware and codebase:

### **WicdMeter Mode: Standalone Wireless Instrument**
Configure as a self-contained wireless meter:
- **Creates its own WiFi hotspot** - no existing network required
- **Serves web-based control panel** - access from any phone, tablet, or laptop
- **Perfect for field instruments** - handheld meters, portable monitors, remote controls
- **Zero infrastructure dependency** - works anywhere with power

*Example: A handheld environmental meter that creates "MeterWiFi" hotspot. Connect your phone, navigate to 192.168.4.1, and control/monitor the instrument through a responsive web interface.*

### **WicdNode Mode: Networked Sensor Node**  
Configure as a node in larger instrumentation networks:
- **Connects to existing WiFi** - joins your lab or facility network
- **MQTT communication** - publishes data to central hub systems
- **Scalable architecture** - deploy 5, 10, or 50+ nodes
- **Centralized monitoring** - all nodes report to unified dashboard

*Example: Precision agriculture research with 20 wicdnodes throughout a greenhouse, all reporting to a Raspberry Pi hub running Home Assistant for data logging and analysis.*

## **Why This Dual Approach Matters**

**Same hardware, same code - different configuration.** Most embedded platforms lock you into one deployment pattern. WicdPico adapts between wicdmeter and wicdnode modes based on your needs:

**Research Labs:** Start with standalone prototypes, scale to networked systems  
**Field Work:** No WiFi? No problem - each device is self-sufficient  
**Education:** Students build instruments that work anywhere  
**Commercial:** Single codebase supports both handheld products and IoT deployments

For example, in precision agriculture research, wicdpico democratizes instrumentation by delivering order-of-magnitude cost reductions compared to commercial CEA systems while maintaining research-quality data collection and control capabilities. This open-source platform enables sub-$50 sensor nodes versus $500+ commercial alternatives, making professional-grade environmental monitoring accessible to resource-constrained research institutions.

Built on proven modular architecture, wicdpico provides a class-based framework for building custom instrument control dashboards and sensor platforms that work equally well as standalone devices or networked systems.

Whether you're monitoring greenhouse conditions, controlling irrigation systems, or developing new CEA instrumentation, wicdpico's modular architecture allows you to rapidly prototype and deploy robust control systems that can be shared and reused across research projects.

## **Design Philosophy: "Lego Blocks for Embedded Interfaces"**

WicdPico is designed as a **modular dashboard system** where functional components can be "bolted in" to create custom embedded instruments. Rather than building monolithic applications, developers can:

- **Select pre-built functional modules** (LED control, sensor monitoring, file management, logging)
- **Configure each module** for specific needs
- **Assemble them** into a unified dashboard
- **Deploy as a complete** embedded instrument

This is **code-based assembly** requiring developer knowledge, but with standardized interfaces that make integration predictable and reliable.

## **Hardware Requirements**

* Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W microcontroller
* Micro USB cable (for initial setup)
* External power source for field deployment
* I2C sensors/actuators as needed for your application

### **Optional Hardware Modules**
* **SHT45 Temperature & Humidity Sensor** - Environmental monitoring
* **SD Card Module** - Data logging and storage
* **PCF8523 RTC** - Real-time clock for timestamping
* **Battery Monitor Circuit** - Power management and monitoring

## **Software Requirements**

* **CircuitPython:** Version 9.0+ with required libraries
* **Core Libraries:** `digitalio`, `board`, `time`, `wifi`, `socketpool`
* **Web Framework:** `adafruit_httpserver` 
* **Module-Specific Libraries:** `adafruit_sht4x`, `adafruit_pcf8523`, etc.

## **Architecture**

### **Three-Layer Design**

**Foundation Layer (`foundation_core.py`)**
- **Dual WiFi management** - Client mode for hub integration, AP mode for standalone
- **Web server framework** - Routes, templates, response handling  
- **Module registration system** - Central registry for all components
- **Robust configuration** - Settings.toml priority with config.py fallback
- **Error recovery** - Graceful handling of network and configuration failures

**Module Layer (Standardized Components)**
Each module follows the `PicowicdModule` base class pattern:
- **Self-contained functionality** - Sensor monitoring, device control, data management
- **Standard interfaces** - Routes, dashboard integration, configuration
- **Configurable parameters** - Exposed at top of file for easy customization
- **Optional logging integration** - Can feed central log and/or display local output

**Template/UI Layer (`foundation_templates.py`)**
- **Responsive CSS framework** - Mobile-friendly, consistent styling
- **Page rendering system** - Unified layout with module content injection
- **Dashboard composition** - Automatic assembly of registered modules

### **Dual-Level Logging System**

**Local Logs**: Function-specific output displayed adjacent to controls
- Temperature readings next to sensor controls
- LED status next to LED buttons  
- File operations next to file manager

**Master Log**: Central system log showing all activity
- Foundation-level events (WiFi status, errors)
- Cross-module system events
- Debug output for troubleshooting

### **Configuration Philosophy**

**Hardcoded** (in module files):
- Buffer sizes, polling intervals, UI layout parameters
- Placed at top of file under imports for easy access
- Developer-level configuration requiring code changes

**User Configurable** (via `settings.toml`):
- Network credentials, MQTT broker settings, operational parameters
- Runtime behavior that end-users might change
- Validated with graceful fallbacks

## **Available Modules**

### **Core Foundation**
* **WiFi Management:** Dual-mode networking (client/AP) with automatic fallback
* **Web Server:** Self-hosted HTTP server with modular dashboard system
* **Template System:** Centralized UI rendering for consistent appearance
* **Configuration System:** Robust settings.toml/config.py handling with error recovery

### **Sensor Modules**
* **SHT45 Module** (`sht45_module.py`): Temperature and humidity monitoring with precision control and heater management
* **Battery Monitor** (`battery_monitor.py`): Real-time battery voltage monitoring and power management
* **RTC Control** (`rtc_control_module.py`): PCF8523 real-time clock management with battery backup detection

### **Communication Modules**
* **MQTT Client** (`mqtt_module.py`): Robust MQTT communication for sensor networks with automatic reconnection
* **LED Control** (`led_control.py`): Visual status indication and user feedback

### **Storage & Management**
* **SD Card Module** (`sd_card_module.py`): Comprehensive file system management and data storage
* **File Manager** (`file_manager.py`): Web-based file editing and system management
* **Console Monitor** (`console_monitor_simple.py`): Real-time system monitoring and debugging

        @server.route("/custom-reading", methods=['POST'])
        def get_reading(request):
            # Handle sensor reading requests
            reading = self.read_sensor()
            return Response(request, f"Reading: {reading}")
        
    def get_dashboard_html(self):
        return '''
        <div class="module">
            <h3>Custom Sensor</h3>
            <button onclick="getReading()">Get Reading</button>
            <div id="reading">Click button for reading</div>
            <script>
            function getReading() {
                fetch('/custom-reading', {method: 'POST'})
                    .then(r => r.text())
                    .then(result => {
                        document.getElementById('reading').innerHTML = result;
                    });
