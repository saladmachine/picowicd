# **WicdPico: Wireless Instrumentation Control Platform**

## **Overview**

WicdPico (wireless instrumentation and control device - Pico) transforms your Raspberry Pi Pico W into a versatile wireless control platform that adapts to your instrumentation needs. Whether you need a standalone handheld instrument or a networked sensor node, wicdpico provides the modular foundation to build professional-grade control systems.

## **Dual Deployment Modes**

WicdPico operates in two distinct modes using the same hardware and codebase:

### **WicdMeter Mode: Standalone Wireless Instrument**
Configure as a self-contained wireless meter:
- **Creates its own WiFi hotspot** - no existing network required
- **Serves web-based control panel** - access from any phone, tablet, or laptop
- **Perfect for field instruments** - handheld meters, portable monitors, remote controls
- **Zero infrastructure dependency** - works anywhere with power

*Example: A handheld environmental meter that creates "MeterWiFi" hotspot. Connect your phone, navigate to 192.168.4.1, and control/monitor the instrument through a responsive web interface.*

### **WicdNode Mode: Networked Sensor Node**  
Configure as a node in larger instrumentation networks:
- **Connects to existing WiFi** - joins your lab or facility network
- **MQTT communication** - publishes data to central hub systems
- **Scalable architecture** - deploy 5, 10, or 50+ nodes
- **Centralized monitoring** - all nodes report to unified dashboard

*Example: Precision agriculture research with 20 wicdnodes throughout a greenhouse, all reporting to a Raspberry Pi hub running Home Assistant for data logging and analysis.*

## **Why This Dual Approach Matters**

**Same hardware, same code - different configuration.** Most embedded platforms lock you into one deployment pattern. WicdPico adapts between wicdmeter and wicdnode modes based on your needs:

**Research Labs:** Start with standalone prototypes, scale to networked systems  
**Field Work:** No WiFi? No problem - each device is self-sufficient  
**Education:** Students build instruments that work anywhere  
**Commercial:** Single codebase supports both handheld products and IoT deployments

For example, in precision agriculture research, wicdpico democratizes instrumentation by delivering order-of-magnitude cost reductions compared to commercial CEA systems while maintaining research-quality data collection and control capabilities. This open-source platform enables sub-$50 sensor nodes versus $500+ commercial alternatives, making professional-grade environmental monitoring accessible to resource-constrained research institutions.

Built on proven modular architecture, wicdpico provides a class-based framework for building custom instrument control dashboards and sensor platforms that work equally well as standalone devices or networked systems.

Whether you're monitoring greenhouse conditions, controlling irrigation systems, or developing new CEA instrumentation, wicdpico's modular architecture allows you to rapidly prototype and deploy robust control systems that can be shared and reused across research projects.

## **Design Philosophy: "Lego Blocks for Embedded Interfaces"**

WicdPico is designed as a **modular dashboard system** where functional components can be "bolted in" to create custom embedded instruments. Rather than building monolithic applications, developers can:

- **Select pre-built functional modules** (LED control, file management, logging, sensors)
- **Configure each module** for specific needs
- **Assemble them** into a unified dashboard
- **Deploy as a complete** embedded instrument

This is **code-based assembly** requiring developer knowledge, but with standardized interfaces that make integration predictable and reliable.

## **Architecture**

### **Three-Layer Design**

**Foundation Layer (`foundation_core.py`)**
- **WiFi AP management** - Creates hotspot, handles network config
- **Web server framework** - Routes, templates, response handling  
- **Module registration system** - Central registry for all components
- **Shared services** - Logging, configuration, utilities

**Module Layer (Standardized Components)**
Each module follows the `PicowidModule` base class pattern:
- **Self-contained functionality** - LED control, file management, sensor monitoring
- **Standard interfaces** - Routes, dashboard integration, configuration
- **Configurable parameters** - Exposed at top of file for easy customization
- **Optional logging integration** - Can feed central log and/or display local output

**Template/UI Layer (`foundation_templates.py`)**
- **Responsive CSS framework** - Mobile-friendly, consistent styling
- **Page rendering system** - Unified layout with module content injection
- **Dashboard composition** - Automatic assembly of registered modules

### **Dual-Level Logging System**

**Local Logs**: Function-specific output displayed adjacent to controls
- Temperature readings next to sensor controls
- LED status next to LED buttons  
- File operations next to file manager

**Master Log**: Central system log showing all activity
- Foundation-level events (WiFi status, errors)
- Cross-module system events
- Debug output for troubleshooting

### **Configuration Philosophy**

**Hardcoded** (in module files):
- Buffer sizes, polling intervals, UI layout parameters
- Placed at top of file under imports for easy access
- Developer-level configuration requiring code changes

**User Configurable** (via `settings.toml`):
- Units (F/C), date formats, network credentials  
- Runtime behavior that end-users might change
- Validated with graceful fallbacks

## **Features**

### **Core Foundation**
* **Self-Hosted Web Server:** Runs directly on the Pico W, serving modular dashboards
* **Wi-Fi Hotspot (Access Point):** Creates a "WicdNode" Wi-Fi network for direct device connection
* **Robust Configuration System:**
    * Crash resistant - falls back to working defaults
    * HTML entity decoding fixes corruption from web sources
    * Individual attribute validation with graceful fallback
    * Self-healing: can connect to default credentials to fix issues
* **Plugin Architecture:** Easy registration and management of functional modules
* **Template System:** Centralized UI rendering for consistent dashboard appearance

### **Standard Modules**
* **LED Control Module:** Toggle and blinky modes for system status indication
* **File Manager Module:** Edit configuration files and code directly on the device
* **Console Monitor Module:** Real-time system output monitoring
* **Template Framework:** For rapid development of new sensor/control modules

### **Power Management**

    def __init__(self, foundation):
        super().__init__(foundation)
        # Initialize your sensor hardware
        
    def register_routes(self, server):
        @server.route("/sensor_data", methods=['GET'])
        def get_sensor_data(request):
            # Handle sensor data requests
            pass
        
    def get_dashboard_html(self):
        # Return HTML for dashboard integration
        return '''
        <div class="module">
            <h3>My Sensor</h3>
            <p>Temperature: <span id="temp">--</span>Â°C</p>
            <button onclick="refreshSensor()">Refresh</button>
        </div>
        '''
        
    def update(self):
        # Called from main loop for real-time updates
        pass
```

Register your module in `code.py`:
